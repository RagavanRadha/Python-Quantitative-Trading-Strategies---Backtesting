# Backtesting Quantitative Trading Strategies
Backtesting a trading strategy is the process of testing a trading hypothesis/strategy on the historical data.

Letâ€™s say you formed a hypothesis. This hypothsesis states that securities that have positive returns over the past one year are likely to give positive returns over the next one month.

How would you test this hypothesis?
How would you know whether the strategy will work in the market or not?
By using historical data, you can backtest and see whether your hypothesis is true or not. It helps assess the feasibility of a trading strategy by discovering how it performs on the historical data.

If you backtest your strategy on the historical data and it gives good returns, you will be confident to trade using it. If the strategy is performing poorly on the historical data, you will discard or re-evaluate the hypothesis.
